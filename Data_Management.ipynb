All data and data analysis is performed in a RMD file, so reproducing the data presented in the analysis is as simple as running the program in RStudio or Posit Cloud. All data is managed as XPT file, csv files, and pdfs. The data itself is preserved in XPT files and a singular csv file.\n","\n","The data has already been collected. The data was collected through questionares as parrt of the NHANES derective. They divide the United States into randomized sections, and partition multiple communities/blocks to questioning and accurate data gathering. This is done through the form of two visits across two days. The languages, R and python, including matplotlib, pandas, and numpy, are used in these analysis. All data gathered by NHANES is already stored on their website, and is in the form of an XPT file.\n","\n","There is an expected 10-12 MB of data gathered and analyzed.
